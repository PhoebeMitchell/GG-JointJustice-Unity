Your Honor, this is clearly irrelevant to the case.

I agree. Arin, try being serious about this.

You said you saw Jory in the 10 Minute Power Hour room, correct?

&JUMP_TO_POSITION:2
&SPEAK:Ross
Yes, that's correct!

&JUMP_TO_POSITION:1
&SET_POSE:PaperSlap

Yet you also say you were in your office animating
&SET_POSE:Confident
Seems very odd to me! How could you see anyone while you were focused on your work!

&JUMP_TO_POSITION:3
&SPEAK:Tutorial_Boy
Are you saying that my witness is a liar?
I'm sure Ross has a very reasonable explanation for all this.

&SCENE:TMPH_Assistant
&SPEAK:Dan
He oughta have a real good reason for this.

&SCENE:TMPH_Court
&JUMP_TO_POSITION:2
&SPEAK:Ross
T-That's right! The reason I was able to see Jory was... because I needed to poop!
Yeah!

Um... excuse me?

(Goddamnit, Ross.)

&SPEAK:Arin
What does you needing to poop have to do with seeing Jory?

&JUMP_TO_POSITION:2
&SPEAK:Ross
W-Well, you see, I had to go out to use the bathroom, which is how I saw Jory!

&JUMP_TO_POSITION:1
&SPEAK:Arin
Uh-huh...
&SET_POSE:Normal
Your Honor, I believe this needs to be added to the witness's testimony.

&SCENE:TMPH_Judge
&SPEAK:Brent_Judge
Agreed. Witness, add your poop story to your testimony.

&SCENE:TMPH_Court
&JUMP_TO_POSITION:2
&SPEAK:Ross
Uh... Yes, why of course, Your Honor. Let me go over it again.

&SCENE:TMPH_Assistant
&SPEAK:Dan
Way to go, Big Cat! Let's see how this changes things.
